# Custom Favicon Recipes

This repo is meant to outline a few neat Favicon recipes that you can use on your own projects to improve the experience for your users and yourself too!

## Recipes:

- Customizing favicons based on `NODE_ENV`
- Light and Dark mode favicons

### Custom Dev/Prod Favicons

You can swap the favicon that you use based on the `NODE_ENV`, allowing you to easily distinguish between a development version of your site and a production version of your site.

The gist is to swap out the `url` for the favicon:

```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Custom favicon per environment",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
  icons: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      url: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
        ? "./env-favicon.ico"
        : "./env-favicon-dev.ico",
    },
  ],
};
```

Check out the [`./apps/environment-favicons` app](./apps/environment-favicons) to see this in practice!

### Light and Dark Mode Favicons

You can swap the favicon that you use based on a `media` attribute on the favicon `<link />` element to serve different favicons based on the desired theme by the user.

```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Custom light/dark mode favicons",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
  icons: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      url: "./sun-favicon.ico",
      media: "(prefers-color-scheme: light)",
    },
    {
      rel: "icon",
      url: "./moon-favicon.ico",
      media: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)",
    },
  ],
};
```
